<h1>Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2> My top three films of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Fantastic movie starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. Based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk with themes that still resonate in the 2020s.</p>

<h3>Miss Congeniality</h3>
<p>Favourite chick flick starring Sandra Bullock. Still sharp with a style of humour and dialogue that is atypical for the genre.</p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>Started watching this one around once a year. A Freaky Friday themed anime in the romance genre with likeable characters and an excellent twist.</p>
